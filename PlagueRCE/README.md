Welcome to PlagueRCE, the ultimate RAT server<br>

Please use this code for educational purposes only, if one of you script kiddies
happen to end up in possession of my code, if you use this in a harmful, unethical or 
illegal manner, you will end up in prison and I will not be held responsible for your
actions. Please note: this server is strictly to be used for pentesting only, therefore
it does not have any functions relating to denial of service attacks or anything else
intended to cause harm.<br>

PlagueRCE is an RAT server which takes commands from user input and executes them on a 
chosen connected client. PlagueRCE supports end to end encryption and has advanced OS detection features.<br>

All CLI features were decided upon by me, anything you dislike or feel is a 'flaw' or 'bug', just
let me know, and if it is valid then I will fix it, however some of these things I decided to keep in 
for a reason, mainly because it would keep my code's performance optimised, keep my code clean,
and most importantly, wouldn't break other parts of my code to implement.<br>

Why the name?<br>
This project is named PlagueRCE, as it is intended to be used as a server
for RAT's which are able to infect multiple clients like a plague.
From this server the user can go in and out of each client's machine
to then carry out RCE (remote code execution).
From this RCE, the user can do various things,
most notably; gain a reverse shell on the client through a utility such as netcat.<br>



The server works in the following way:<br>
1. user connects to client via user input of the chosen clients ip address.<br>

2. user inputs a command to be executed by the chosen client.<br> 

3. client executes the command. (If the command is a CLI command it will
be executed by the server and not be executed by the chosen client)<br>

4. In the case of a client disconnecting from the server mid way through sending a command
or receiving a response, the server will remove the client from the list of connected clients.<br>

5. Everytime a client sends a response back to the user, it is stored within the response list
which can be accessed via various commands such as 'current_latest'.<br>

Send P1NGS3RV3R to server to test connection from client<br>



Encryption mode (NOT RECOMMENDED):<br>
ENCRYPTION MODE DOES NOT SUPPORT LARGE INPUT OR OUTPUT DATA
Before using encryption mode, please note that it will not work properly with large input or
output data and therefore I do not recommend using encryption mode at all.<br>

Each generated key pair is a 4096 bit RSA key pair.<br>
Why 4096 bit? any lower won't handle much data, any larger will take too much 
computer power, it's for the users own safety (I only expect less skilled pentesters
to use this rather than coding their own RAT)<br>

When a client connects to the server, it treats the current key pair
on the server in encryption mode as the clients permanent key pair, so make sure you are
using encryption mode properly otherwise it can cause problems with server/client communication.<br>
For this reason, I suggest you to stay on encryption mode the entire time and not generate a new key pair
when you are working on large scale operations, as it will have a high chance of causing problems.<br>
When you generate a key pair, configure the key pair with your payload and then have the client
execute the payload for encrypted communication.<br>



CLI<br>

- Upon entering a command, if the command is a CLI command, it will be executed by the server
and not executed by the currently connected client.<br>
- If the command is not a CLI command it will be executed by the currently connected client.
Ensure each CLI command entered is spelled correctly to prevent unwanted results.<br>

/ escapes send options and CLI commands (e.g. /$command will have client execute $command)<br>

Send command options<br>
By default, commands are executed on the first payload on the currently connected client<br>
$command: $ before a command to execute command on all payloads on currently connected client<br> 
!command: ! before a command to execute command on first payload across all clients<br> 
?command: ? before a command to execute command to execute command on all payloads across all clients<br> 
*command: * before a command to execute the command on first payload on all clients using a particular OS<br>
&command: & before a command to execute the command on all payloads across all clients using a particular OS<br>


User help<br> 
help: Show this message<br>
quit: Exit the program<br>

Encryption mode (NOT RECOMMENDED)<br>
current_keys: Display current server key pair if in encryption mode<br>
encryption_mode: Enable encryption mode, and generate a new key pair<br>
new_keys: Generate new server key pair (dangerous) or use own key pair<br> 
unencryption_mode: Disable encryption mode and delete existing key pair<br>

Current connected client
current: Show client the user is currently connected to
current_latest: Show latest response from currently connected client
current_all: Show all responses from currently connected client
change: Change the current connected client

All connected clients<br>
list: List all connected clients and their information<br>
who_responded: Display list of all clients who have sent a response to server<br>
responses_amount: Trigger temporary CLI to show specific amount of responses from a client<br>
responses_latest: Trigger temporary CLI to show the latest response from a client<br>
responses_all: Display all responses from all clients<br>
responses_all_OS: Display all responses from all clients using a particular OS<br>



Connection information:<br>

Connections are made through TCP (transmission control protocol).<br>
Messages sent between the server and client are sent utf-8 encoded.<br>
The bytesize of the messages being sent between the server and client is 1024.<br>
